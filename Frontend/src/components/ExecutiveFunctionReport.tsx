            The PSI composite score is comprised of two subtests including Coding and Symbol Search. On the Coding
            subtest, {subject} was presented with numbers paired with symbols, and was asked to copy symbols to numbers
            where no symbols were present within a time limit. The Coding subtest is a measure of short-term visual memory
            and speed of mental operations. On the Symbol Search subtest, {subject} was presented with a symbol, asked to
            choose the identical symbol in a row of 􀀂ve symbols. If the symbol is not present in the row, {subject} was asked to
            choose NO as an option. The subtest also has a time limit. The Symbol Search subtest is a measure of visual
            perception, visual scanning ability, attention, and processing speed of visual stimuli. Since {subject} obtained a
            higher score on Coding than the Symbol Search subtest with scaled scores of 16 and 13 respectively, it indicates
            that {subject}’s ability to shift mental operations with ease and speed is better developed than her visual scanning,
            visual perceptual skills, and the ability to attend to a rote task. However, {subject} performed in the Above-Average
            to Superior range and obtained her highest composite score on these two subtests indicating that these are her
            best developed skills/abilities compared to other skills/abilities evaluated on the assessment and signi􀀂cant
            strengths for her.
