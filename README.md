This system was created as an independent study project at Empire State University. IQreport allows a user(Psychiatrist) to register a new account and sign in after registration. Once signed in, the user can create new Reports by entering the required data (Subject information and raw evaluation scores). Subjects are created in the process if they do not already exist. After the raw scores are entered, the system will make all calculations and generate the final Report. Users are also able to view a list of existing Subjects and Reports, as well as view individual Subjects and Reports by clicking on an item in either list. Furthermore, if viewing an individual Subject, a user can also view Reports associated with the Subject by clicking on it in the Subject's profile. Lists can be sorted/searched by all fields to shorten search time. The system is built using Nest.js for the backend, Vite for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database.
